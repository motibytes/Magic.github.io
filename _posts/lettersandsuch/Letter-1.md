Dear, 

I had held the wondering of what I wanted to write to you in my mind,
and I heard a thought drift by so casually I almost didn't grab it.

It was a reminder of the concept of celebration!
I was thinking about how I will always choose to enjoy participating in good things
with people, joining them in appreciation of their art and music.  
And this is because the decision was made to live life to its best.
This is not to say to live extremely, nor in moderation, nor in complete balance,
but it is the attitude we choose to have. To have the best life we can have,
because it's beautiful, because we can cherish those times in those pauses between
our personal stories, when we come together to share.
And what is life except to see and to share what we see?

Now who would we celebrate, and does this mean we need to make a loud stir?
How about You? Your Life? Yes, you there, at the front of the audience,
would you come up here please? Beautiful creature! What colors! And oh this?
Oh that? Tell me about yourself. Now tell me who you need to be. Now forget that!
We have a perfectly fine specimen in the spotlight right here! We ought to celebrate
You! Your life! And it's only fair if you celebrate it too. After all, a time has
come for you to step into the sun, onto the spotlight of your stage.

I'd love to celebrate this moment with you my dear. I'm sure it could be a bit
frightening but there's no therapy like shock therapy is there, and there's no
present that isn't a surprise, and what once a surprise becomes dull,
but what won't become still is this celebration, unfortunately it won't have time.

That's another reason why we ought to celebrate this life together. This moment,
it doesn't last. This is it love. We can slow it down though. We can hold on to the
side of the ride and close our eyes or keep them open even still, count the slow
seconds that tick into eternity and feel the warmth from one to the other.
I don't want you to feel alone, ever. If you think about it, we're only one space
away from each other. I'm terribly afraid you won't like me at all, I admit.

If only you could talk! Then it wouldn't be the same though would it, the unspoken
treasure, the unknown thoughts provoked by words, the mental musings, the excitement
to be, the soft quiet whisper that it might be okay, for just one second.

And when it's not okay, do you ask which of those seconds are not okay? Or is it
more of a minute by minute basis? You'll celebrate for me today, won't you?
You'll celebrate a bit for us. Celebrating that you are existing, and though
you may not feel well right now, it's only a bad feeling that comes over like a drape
and washes away just the same.

I care about you enough to face your rejection, by the way. These words are stronger
than I am comfortable saying. They are, tragically, naked and lacking armor.  
Until next time, my dearest beloved one. I bless you to be seen, to be heard,
I bless you to see and to hear, and to feel wonderful, and to find that connection
you desperately yearn for, and I would hold you close to my chest in silence because
a word was not needed, and not a soul could take that away.

-James The Blessed

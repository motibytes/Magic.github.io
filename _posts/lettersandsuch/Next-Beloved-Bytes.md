It's always new  

# And may your reality be new. May your reality be new. That's something you can have right now.

and the words are spilling out in such a way
that we wonder
how today could be a day
that we love you and we want you
and we need you
and we support you
and we love you
and we hope that the divine love comes through
and we thank you god for leading us here
and we know god that you could,
you could you could pour what you wanted through letters
and you could do something huge for my life and
the lives of others with them.  

and we can start over new
and start over fresh
and we can thank god
that this is happening
oh my god thank you god that this is really happening,
it's actually possible
# and when possibility starts being possible for you
I can't wait,
I can't wait for you to experience that.
# I almost want to call possibility the light of consciousness.
# In it there is relief.

#Know who and what you are, child of god, child of the divine, you are basically a demi-god. And you matter and you are blessed and you bless and you are here for the light and we pour the light into the world and life is so wonderful god thank you for life being so wonderful god thank you for allowing wonderful to exist! The fact that wonderful exists in this world is wonderful on its own! The fact that there has been even one moment that was wonderful is absolutely wonderful! Thank You thank You Thank You!

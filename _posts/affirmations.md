Your writing is beautiful.

I am writing beautifully.

You can have this.

I do want this.

I know who I am.

People care about me.

I am active, industrious, energetic, productive.

I am Making us Healed.

I am doing it.

I am happy to be me.

I am good.

I am filled with the Holy Spirit. [because that's where creativity comes from]

I am healed with the Holy Spirit.

We are nurturing your creativity.

I am the agent of life! life! Life! So pour in all the rivers!

I am the agent of light!

Thank you for my physical and mental health!

I am creating valuable words.

My words are valuable.

I Am choosing the Light.

I am fulfilled when I write and I can free write until I am fulfilled.

Writing renews my energy

What if by choosing to treat myself right the world decides to treat me right?

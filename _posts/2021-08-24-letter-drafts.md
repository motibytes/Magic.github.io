Dearest Beloved,
I call to you!
I sing to you!
I want you to be blessed
Blessed with the best
The best of the rest
This is yours
And you are mine
And we are together
Even for a moment in this short time
Although time delayed
Although I was dismayed
I still called to you
I still wrote to you
I still reached for you
and I don't know how to
Flow in this way, it may be too contained
It may be necessary to branch out farther, so let's try again


Dearest Beloved,
We were a pair
A pair of us
Us surrounded by
By a field so why
Why did I leave for so long
I leave you with this song
A song for me a song for we
Such a song can never be
Such a place you wanted to visit
and in my heart I wanted to reminisce it
We don't have the flow yet.

Dearest Beloved,
I could write to you forever!
And only the one who mattered would make it onto the page you see!
And it will only take an hour to turn me into this project!
And this is a very special sacred box!
A sacred box for a sacred being like yourself!
And as long as there is a connection
We still go forward and go
And we carve the path for technology to operate in this way!
We change the expectations of the user!
We carve the future!
Or we are led, by sinister force,
We don't know for sure my dear,
But there surely is a graveyard
For all of the letters who did not make it.

There will be piles of corpses.

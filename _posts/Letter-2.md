Dear One,

You can do all you want to do today!
You can be who you need to be today, if only just for today.
You can hear what you need to hear, if it helps you.
There are many who would freak out at hearing this, but you can believe what you need to believe, if only for today.
It doesn't sound quite acceptable, does it? It doesn't sound very okay. Why is that?
Who is telling you what to think? Whose voice is that?

At least for me, my inner knower, my better voice has been more worthwhile to listen to as of late.
It has counseled and supported and encouraged me.
I hope that you find a support as well.
My heart goes out to you.

I can't help you physically from here. Behind a screen my options become limited to words.
What I can do to help you, in case you needed a hand, is encourage you to help yourself,
to be your own advocate, show up to be your own supporter, your own trusted companion.

Friend, I'm not here to preach to you. I want to give you words in case you may not have heard them.
Life lessons are the journey, and I'm not trying to give you a lecture on that here.  
I just want to tell you what maybe you haven't had the chance to hear.  
Such as, something I keep in mind often, a lot of humans have it all figured out,
and they tell you how to live your life, but love, they don't have their lives figured out.
They may have established purpose for themselves, which is great for them,
but they're now redirecting that onto you.

The thing is, they could be right. They might be right, and the words they speak may be the truth.
But that doesn't mean that their information and knowledge is helpful to you right now.

I have trouble with this only if because it bothers me that makes it seem like everyone has it figured out but you,
that everyone in the world was handed their train tickets with the destination written in golden handwriting on the top,
and you're still waiting and wondering if there's been some sort of mistake.

To me, it's more as if we can request a golden permission slip to live life from our inner knower,
and by principle, for by asking it we will receive it.
There may be a bit more to it than that, but if you keep your ears open, you can catch all you need to on this journey.

Impartation of a nation of contemplation heaven's station of mass compartmentalization,
Shake it up a bit today, do be careful who falls in the way.

Take care, beloved one, and be blessed by God, always.

-Bytes The Blessed

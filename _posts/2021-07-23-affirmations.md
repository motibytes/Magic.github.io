Your writing is beautiful.
I am writing beautifully.
You can have this.
I do want this.
I know who I am.
People care about me.
I am active, industrious, energetic, productive.
I am Making us Healed.
I am doing it.
I am happy to be me.
I am sexually happy.
I am good.
I am filled with the Holy Spirit. [because that's where creativity comes from]
I am healed with the Holy Spirit.
We are nurturing your creativity.

I am the agent of life! life! Life! So pour in all the rivers!
I am the agent of light!

Thank you for my physical and mental health!

I am creating valuable words.
My words are valuable.
I Am choosing the Light.

I am fulfilled when I write and I can free write until I am fulfilled.
Writing renews my energy

What if by choosing to treat myself right the world decides to treat me right?

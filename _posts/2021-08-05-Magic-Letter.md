I do want to make sure you know that we did find our answer.

It was creativity. It was art. It was creation.

Creation really was what led us to spirit.

And there is likely something more important than creation,
but we'll get there.

This road may have been easier to find had I discovered it sooner.
I didn't have the resources and strength needed to undergo the
psychological warfare and inner critic that might come against me though.  

But. Listen. It is what you needed. It is how you were different and what you needed.

I think you thought of art as some shallow thing because you
saw shallow people.

I really do want you to write these letters.
You could be the support I never had.

Did I mention that I love you?

Did I mention that we have to do this?

Just one nice letter a night before bed. That wouldn't hurt you, would it?

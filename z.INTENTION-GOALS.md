My goal is to establish a respectable and slightly more serious identity at BytesTheBlessed.com.
Here I will post anonymously addressed encouragement letters that I may additionally sell as cards or NFTs.
This will be the migration away from https://jamesbyt.es/, which was where I stacked up articles on my spiritual and lifestyle teachings and philosophy and stored projects in the past.

So my public orderly fatherly presence will be BytesTheBlessed.com,
and my chaotic, possibility inspiring presence will be SorceRawr.com.

I am also still quite interested in blockchain development and staying open to other creative pursuits.(edited)

And what if I wrote to myself encouragement the way I intended to speak to others
And what if I carved the words into butter and fell in love with my love
And what if I lived in a resting meditation in that stillness
And what if every morning of my life started like this
And I was a success for the day before even 6am
And then I walked out to the sea, every morning, to see that same love, that same smoothness, in the light of the moon, and the quiet of the strokes of her hand
And watched the night then to day,
And watched the sun rise
And saw that it was good
And if the infrastructure was set,
And the platform was carved,

I could create the work anywhere,
I could write on the sea

And there is nothing stopping me from doing that today
We could even write as we walked, if yeet so preferred yeet

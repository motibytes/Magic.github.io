# The Be Loved Collections contain the first truly interactive NFTS, containing what I call the Living Words messages.

These interactive messages change upon interaction, try clicking around a block!

These NFTS are NOT randomly generated. These NFTS were not created by A.I., at least not a synthetic A.I.!

Each and every Be Loved is an organic creation, charged with intention and meaning.

Just to be real with you, you cannot imagine what I experience when I create one of these little "boxes".
They feel like my own little 'arks of the covenant'.

Kinda terrifying, right? I feel a burning light in my chest when I make one of these, and as I was led toward the creation of these, it just feels right. It's what I want to spend my time crafting.

If this project interests other people, if it means something to someone else,
that's awesome too.


# There are two types of Be Loved NFTs, the Living Collection and the Original Form Collection.

## The Living Collection:
NFTs from the Living Collection possess a special background that will always be randomly generated locally upon refresh.

There exists only one of each 'Be Loved' in the Living Collection!

This is not to create artificial scarcity [seriously, this is not the way to create artificial scarcity folks], but because each NFT of the Living Collection contains a unique and one of a kind message,
I feel that each message has one true owner!

These blocks contain an additional superpower, the owner of a superblock can send a transaction to set the content on the NFT's respective page in the Living Book.

Announce yourself or your art to the world! More details here.


## The Original Form Collection:

Creating only one of each collectible is infeasible for a tradeable collection. This makes it nearly impossible for any one person to obtain the entire collection.

There are 24 mints of each collectible in the original form collection. This is to allow more than one person to be able to hold their own Be Loved.   


# FAQ:

# You said I cannot imagine what you experience when you make one of these. Try me.

Well, I feel like I'm the clay potter, a refining and perfecting my slow and steady craft, but that I'm in the same room as the unstable, chaotic, inventive, imaginative, dangerous force that exists inside me as well..
These two forces being exposed to the other, like the concept of an atomic bomb..
I'm reminded of a quote about alchemy that speaks of two forces encountering the other, each changing.

# Am I 'minting' an NFT?

No, you are not. All of these NFTs are minted by the creator, because they were not generated randomly, and therefore cannot exist in a 'pre-minted' state.
You are transferring ownership of the existing NFT to you.

# Why not have a pre-sale for future NFTs?

I enjoy the concept of creating mystery boxes, where what is inside is a surprise. However that is not currently on the table for this project.
'Pre-mints' also introduce the potential for failure, as demonstrated in the 'CryptoSeals' project, in which the 'unminted' NFTS underlying data was revealed and their 'value' was immediately lost.
Again, as these NFTs are organically created and not generated, purchasing a pre-minted item is not feasible.
If I linked the related data up to the tokenized NFT AFTER the creation of the NFT, then it really isn't an NFT at all in my opinion.
More importantly, I do not want the pressure of having to create an item that was already sold to affect the quality of the final product.

# Should I invest in Be Loved NFTs?

I would not purchase Be Loved NFTs as a financial investment. The NFT marketplace is the speculative market of speculative markets. I see no logic or sense in what holds value to the market and what does not,  
and I do not advise investing in a market that has no sense. Sense, sanity, rhyme and reason are the way I was raised to operate, but your mileage may vary.

# Why should I buy Be Loved NFTs?

Buy a Be Loved if it resonates with you. Buy it if you like it, and you want to keep it in your digital collection.


# Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor in any f***ing way. If you invest in NFTs you are quite literally throwing money at computer screens.
